== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works should work fine with most WordPress 3.X
However it was mainly tested with 4.0 So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.
= Is the Basic version a fully functional version or is it limited in some way? =
The Basic and the Clubs (Premium) are the same version the only difference is that a limit of 25 competitors applies to the Basic version. This make it fully functional for small clubs.

This is generally not required since all software is the same and different function are enabled depending on the key you purchase for one of the premium versions.
